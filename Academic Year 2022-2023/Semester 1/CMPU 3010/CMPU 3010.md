# *City Bikes Case Study Description*

![](_page_1_Picture_2.jpeg)

A European City has a bicycle rental scheme. Bicycle stations are distributed at locations around the city. Each station has multiple bike stands. **Cyclists** who have subscribed can borrow a bike from one station, cycle to another station and return it. To subscribe to the service, the cyclist must provide a credit card number, name, address, and phone number. A 4-digit personal identification number (PIN) and a CyclistNo are allocated to the new subscriber.

Stations are identified by station Id and have a location and GPS code. There are numbered stands at each station. Each stand can hold one bike. The status of a stand (standstatus) denotes whether it is functioning ('F') or damaged ('D'). Each bike has an identifying serial number (bikeId), a date of purchase and a status (bikestatus), with a value of 'R' (ready to be deployed), 'M' (being maintained), 'D' (deployed), 'C' for check (a cyclist has reported a problem) or 'X' (expired).

To borrow a bike, the cyclist goes to a station and enters their cyclistno, PIN and stand number. The system releases the bike from the stand, clearing the bikeId attribute in the stand, and recording a new rental. Cyclists can view their own rental history.

To return a bike, the cyclist locks the bike into an empty stand. This causes the rental to terminate, recording the ReturnTime and allocating the BikeId to the stand.

**Drivers** monitor the stations and move bikes from full to empty stations. The drivers check bikes with status = 'C' and may remove bikes for maintenance, changing bike status to 'M'. The driver can change the status of damaged stands to 'D'.

**Mechanics** fix bikes and stands and update the status of both. If a bike is beyond repair, the mechanic marks its status as 'X'. When a stand has been fixed, the mechanic returns its status to 'F'.

**Managers** monitor rentals and repairs and replace bikes where necessary, adding new bikes and removing those with a status of 'X'. If a problem is reported, a manager can set the bike status to 'C' or the stand status to 'D'. Managers also add and remove stations, stands and bikes.

### **Figure 1 Entity Relationship Diagram for City Bikes**

## **Question 1 (compulsory) [40 marks]**

- 1. (a) Users of the City Bikes system are listed as column headers in Table 1. Copy the table into your answer book and fill the boxes with permissions (S for select, I for insert, U for update) that each type of user should have, using the description in *City Bikes Case Study Description*, using the principle of least privilege. (8 **marks)**

|  | Cyclist | Driver | Mechanic | Manager |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |

Table 1 User privileges

*[Continued on next page]*

- 1. (b) Write queries to do the following: (3x6 marks)
(i) Write SQL to return a list of each bike and the number of times it has been rented, including bikes that have never been rented. **(6 marks)**

(ii) Write SQL to list the rental history (i.e. all rentals) of bikes that have a status of 'X'.

**(6 marks)**

(iii) Write SQL to list stations where all stands are full (i.e. the bikeId is not null). **(6 marks)**

- (c) Write a PLpgSQL function and trigger to prevent a cyclist from renting a bicycle if the cyclist has a previous rental that has not been returned. **(14 marks)**
# **Question 2 [30 marks]**

- 2. City Bikes employs mechanics to keep the bikes in good working order and looking well. When a mechanic has worked on a bike, he / she records the hours worked on a bike on a date, giving a description of what was done and the outcome of the repair. When bike faults are reported, they are categorized by fault type – e.g. 'Elec'. Each fault type has a type description. In addition to this, the specific fault has a description. Using a copy of the weekly maintenance report, as shown in Table 2 (see next page), do the following:

| (a) | Represent the data in unnormalized form. | (6 marks) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| (b) | Represent the date in First Normal Form. | (6 marks) |
| (c) | Represent the data in Second Normal Form. | (6 marks) |
| (d) | Represent the data in Third Normal Form. | (6 marks) |
| (e) | Draw a fully normalized ERD to represent the entities derived by the normalization process, |  |
|  | showing primary and foreign keys, attributes and relationships. | (6 marks) |

| UserId 44, 22/11/2022: (Id 4001) I borrowed on 21st November 2022 from Parnell Street, stand |
| --- |
| 3, had grease spilt on it. It was too dirty to use, so I put it back.' |

### **Table 3 Sample Customer Complaints**

- 3. Due to a rising number of customer queries and complaints, City Bikes has decided to introduce a formal customer communication system. Some of the communications give full details, giving the bike id, station and stand, and details of a problem with either the bike or stand. Some are reporting a fault with a specific stand, or a failing of the station – i.e. there are too many / too few bikes at the stand. Some give a message without any specifics.
	- (a) Create a MongoDB collection that would allow the user to enter any of the communications in

Table 3, ensuring that every communication has a cyclistno and date. (5 **marks)**

- (b) Write code to insert the first row from Table 3 into your new collection. (5 **marks)**
- (c) Extend the ERD shown in Figure 1, to accommodate the new communications, ensuring that your new table or tables are fully normalized. **(10 marks)**
- (d) Discuss your preference for how this data should be stored, giving reasons. **(10 marks)**

*[Question 4 on next page]*

### **Question 4 [30 marks]**

4. From the description in *City Bikes Case Study Description*, bike rental is describes as *"To borrow a bike, the cyclist goes to a station and enters their cyclistno, PIN and stand number. The system releases the bike from the stand, clearing the bikeId attribute in the stand, and recording a new rental".*

- (a) Assuming the data is stored in a relational database with the conceptual schema as shown in the ERD in Figure 1, write a PLpgSQL procedure, complete with error checking, to borrow a bike, using the following steps:
	- 1. Take in the subscriber's UserId, PIN, stationId and standNo.
	- 2. Check that the stand exists and currently holds a bike, exiting if this is not true.
	- 3. Check that the subscriber with this cyclistno exists and has this PIN, exiting if this is not true.
	- 4. Add a new rental, setting the borrowTime to the current time (NOW()).
	- 5. Remove the bikeid from the stand. **(30 marks)**

*Marks will be allocated for forming parameter passing correctly (6 marks), using appropriate SQL statements (6), handling errors correctly (6), general overall logic (12)*
