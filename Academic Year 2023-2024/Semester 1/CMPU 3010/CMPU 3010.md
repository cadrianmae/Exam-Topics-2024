## *Rent A Home Case Study Description*

### **Case Study ERD 1 Rent-a-Home**

Rent-a-Home is an online business that facilitates the rental of domestic homes. Listings show the property, its general location (i.e. an area, such as Dublin 7), the type of property (e.g. apartment, studio, bedroom) and the landlord's details. When a property is available for rent, it has a rental status (r_status) of 'F' for Free. If rented, it has a rental status of 'R' for rented. Only free properties are made visible. **Landlords** register with Rent-a-Home, with an initial ApprovalStatus of 'P' for pending. They may have their own website (lordURL), with images and further details of their properties, but neither the landlord nor their listings will be made visible on Rent-a-Home's site until they have been approved (ApprovalStatus= 'A'). Discredited landlords have an approvalStatus of 'X' and their properties are not visible. Landlords can register their properties for listing themselves. If they want a new location or rental type added, they must contact Rent-a-Home so the manager can add locations or rental types. The landlord can directly update viewings and add rentals.

**Seekers** can register on the Rent-a-Home site, giving their name and phone number. They can browse listed properties. If a seeker wishes to view a listed property, they can add a viewing, with an initial viewstatus of 'P' for pending and a null viewdate.

**Agents** who show the properties update any pending viewings, adding a viewdate and changing the viewstatus to 'A' for arranged. When the viewing is complete, they change the viewstatus to 'C'. **Managers** approve landlords and add rental types (r_type) and locations (loccode).

**Case Study 1 Description of Rent-a-Home**

### **Question 1 (compulsory) [40 marks]**

- 1. (a) Users of the Rent-a-Home system are listed as column headers in Table 1. Copy the table into your answer book and fill the boxes with permissions (S for select, I for insert, U for update) that each type of user should have, using the description in Case Study 1 Description of Renta-Home, using the principle of least privilege. (6 **marks)**

|  | Landlord | Seeker | Manager | Agent |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Seeker |  |  |  |  |
| Landlord |  |  |  |  |
| Listing |  |  |  |  |
| R_location |  |  |  |  |
| Rental_type |  |  |  |  |
| Rental |  |  |  |  |
| Viewing |  |  |  |  |

#### Table 1 User privileges

- (b) Write queries to do the following: (3x6 marks)
(i) Write SQL to return each listing (l_address, area, lordname, r_type) that should be visible (read Case Study 1 description) for rent in the city named 'Dublin'. **(6 marks)**

(ii) Write SQL to list the rentals each landlord has, giving the listing address (l_address), seeker name (s_name), landlord's name (lordname), the start date of the rental (startdate) and the rank of this rental, ordered by startdate, for this landlord. **(6 marks)**

(iii) Write **efficient** SQL to list locations (country, city, area) that have no properties listed for rental. **(6 marks)**

- (c) Write a PLpgSQL trigger to remove all properties not currently rented (r_status = 'R'), and the viewings associated with those properties for landlords with an ApprovalStatus value of 'X' for discredited. This trigger should fire every time the landlord table is updated. (16 **marks)**
*Marks will be allocated for correct use of data from triggering operation (6), using appropriate SQL statements (5), and general overall logic (5).*

**Table 2 Weekly Viewing Log, Rent-a-home.**

- 2. Rent-a-Home employ agents to assist in showing listed properties. They keep a log of which properties were viewed and when, who is the landlord, who showed the property and to whom it was shown. Each landlord has a unique phone number and every agent has a unique Agent Id.
	- (a) Represent the viewing log shown in Table 2 in un-normalized form. **(6 marks)**
	- (b) Represent the data in First Normal Form. **(6 marks)**
	- (c) Represent the data in Second Normal Form. **(6 marks)**
	- (d) Represent the data in Third Normal Form. **(6 marks)**
	- (e) Draw a fully normalized ERD to represent the resulting entities, showing primary and foreign keys, attributes and relationships. **(6 marks)**

#### **Question 3 [30 marks]**

- 3 After viewings, seekers are asked to give feedback on the property and their viewing experience, specifically including a review of the agent. The company is undecided as to how to store the feedback, and are considering either MongoDB, or an extension of the current relational model. Sample feedback is given below:
- Ciara Donnelly: "I viewed both 1a and 1d Happy Home., both I preferred 1d because of its aspect. Donncha showed me both places on 17th October. He was friendly and helpful and told me what my financing options could be."
- Sarah Sheehan: "Molly Lyons showed me a room in George's Place. I think it was 10th Oct. I really didn't like the room. It was much too expensive for what was on offer. The following day I looked at a different room in the same property with a different agent. I won't rent either."
- Sean Moloney: "A friend of mine told me about the rooms that are for rent near the university and I went along on to have a look. A smarmy guy called Donncha showed me around. Yeah, if Ciara moves in, I'll take it."
	- (a) Amend the ERD shown in Case Study 1, to accommodate this feedback, ensuring that your altered table or tables are fully normalized. **(10 marks)**
	- (b) Create a MongoDB collection that would allow the user to enter any of the feedback, ensuring that every document has a seeker name, listing address, agent id and date. **(5 marks)**
	- (c) Write code to insert Sean's feedback into your new collection, noting any problems that may occur, giving reasons. **(5 marks)**
	- (d) Discuss your preference for how this data should be stored, giving reasons. (5 **marks)**
	- (e) State whether you would change your mind if Rent-a-home had multiple servers holding viewing data and the database was geographically distributed over several nodes in different cities, giving reasons. **(5 marks)**

#### **Question 4 [30 marks]**

- 4. (a) Write a function arrange_viewing to take in a viewingid and date and update the viewing with that viewing id to change the date to the one passed and to change the viewstatus to 'A' for arranged. Throw an error if the viewingid does not exist or if some other error occurs. Return a message to tell the user if the viewing has been arranged. **(25 marks)**
*Marks will be allocated for forming parameter passing correctly (5), using appropriate SQL statements (5), handling errors correctly (5), general overall logic (10)*

- (b) Write SQL to run arrange_viewing, providing appropriate parameters. **(5 marks)**
